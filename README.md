## Features
âœ… Pure Bare-Metal Implementation â€“ No HAL, no middleware, just direct register manipulation.

âœ… Atomic RTCC Initialization â€“ Follows Microchipâ€™s exact recommended hardware sequence.

âœ… Peak Hour Detection â€“ Configurable time windows for multi-tariff applications.

âœ… UART Debugging Support â€“ Displays real-time clock status.

âœ… Hardware-Optimized â€“ Uses cycle-accurate delays (NOP instructions) for stability.

âœ… BCD â†” Decimal Conversion â€“ Efficient handling of RTC register formats.
## Who should use this rep?
This repository is ideal for:

-Embedded developers working with PIC32MZ series microcontrollers.

-Engineers who need precise RTC control without abstraction layers.

-Developers implementing time-based billing, scheduling, or logging.

-Anyone learning bare-metal PIC32 programming.
## PIC32MZ2048EFG100
The PIC32MZ2048EFG100 is a high-performance 32-bit microcontroller from Microchip, featuring:

-200 MHz MIPS microAptiv core.

-2MB Flash, 512KB SRAM.

-Integrated RTCC (Real-Time Clock Calendar) with battery backup support.

-Multiple communication peripherals (UART, SPI, IÂ²C)

-This repo focuses on its hardware RTCC module, which maintains time/date even during power loss (with battery backup).
## Prerequisites
Hardware Requirements

âœ” PIC32MZ2048EFG100 microcontroller

âœ” 32.768 kHz crystal (for RTCC clock source)

âœ” Backup battery (if continuous timekeeping is needed)

âœ” UART interface (for debugging output)

Software Requirements

âœ” MPLAB X IDE with XC32 compiler

âœ” Datasheet (PIC32MZ Family Reference Manual, Section 37 - RTCC)

âœ” Basic understanding of register-level programming
## Updates and Bugs
Planned Improvements

ðŸ”¹ Multiple peak periods (e.g., morning + evening peak hours)

ðŸ”¹ Day-specific rules (weekdays vs. weekends)

ðŸ”¹ Leap year handling (currently relies on correct user input)

ðŸ”¹ Low-power mode support (battery backup optimization)

Known Limitations

âš  Single peak window per day (only one start/end time supported).

âš  No timezone handling (assumes 24-hour UTC-like operation).

âš  Year 2000-2099 assumption (2-digit BCD year storage).
